It may close during strong winds or for maintenance, so check the schedule in advance.','Morning visits, around 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM, offer shorter lines and cooler temperatures, ideal for enjoying the views from the summit. This time also provides clearer skies, often allowing for better visibility of landmarks like Notre-Dame and the Seine River.','https://www.toureiffel.paris/en','Booking a timed ticket online helps avoid long queues, and the summit elevator ride offers the best views, so don’t miss it if heights aren’t an issue.

Last entry is one hour before closing, and some galleries may close for special exhibitions, so plan ahead.','Morning visits, around 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, offer a quieter experience with fewer crowds, ideal for seeing popular works like the Mona Lisa. This time also allows you to explore the museum’s vast collection in cooler, less hectic conditions.','https://www.louvre.fr/en','The Louvre is massive, so prioritize key sections like the Denon Wing for the Mona Lisa, and consider renting an audio guide for context, as signage can be minimal.
